       "  'Slow-frequency variability in ADHD, rather, may be a consequence of specific disruption within the arousal system.',\n",
       "  'This hypothesis awaits confirmation with neuroimaging.',\n",
       "  'Third, the ADHD and HFA groups both showed heightened levels of commission errors on the Random SART, compared with the control group, suggesting deficits in response inhibition.',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, the finding of a response inhibition deficit in the HFA group that was of comparable effect size to the ADHD group, adds to a burgeoning literature suggesting inhibitory deficits in HFA.',\n",
       "  'Fourth, the HFA group made a normal number of commission errors on the Fixed SART, possibly by utilising the predictable sequence of digits preceding the NoGo “3” stimulus as cues, which is suggestive of a systematizing aptitude.',\n",
       "  'This study provides detailed behavioural evidence of significantly greater sustained attention dysfunction in ADHD than in HFA.',\n",
       "  'This behavioural deficit in ADHD may be underpinned by greater dysfunction within fronto-parietal areas and the subcortical arousal system.'],\n",
       " 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism are two neurodevelopmental disorders associated with prominent executive dysfunction, which may be underpinned by disruption within fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal circuits. We probed executive function in these disorders using a sustained attention task with a validated brain-behaviour basis. Twenty-three children with ADHD, 21 children with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 18 control children were tested on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). In a fixed sequence version of the task, children were required to withhold their response to a predictably occurring no-go target (3) in a 1-9 digit sequence; in the random version the sequence was unpredictable. The ADHD group showed clear deficits in response inhibition and sustained attention, through higher errors of commission and omission on both SART versions. The HFA group showed no sustained attention deficits, through a normal number of omission errors on both SART versions. The HFA group showed dissociation in response inhibition performance, as indexed by commission errors. On the Fixed SART, a normal number of errors was made, however when the stimuli were randomised, the HFA group made as many commission errors as the ADHD group. Greater slow-frequency variability in response time and a slowing in mean response time by the ADHD group suggested impaired arousal processes. The ADHD group showed greater fast-frequency variability in response time, indicative of impaired top-down control, relative to the HFA and control groups. These data imply involvement of fronto-parietal attentional networks and sub-cortical arousal systems in the pathology of ADHD and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in children with HFA.')"

       " {'F1': 'A pictorial representation of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), demonstrating the sequence of events and timings for the SART. Figure depicts (A) a go trial (requiring a response to the presentation of the go-digit 1), and (B) a no-go trial (requiring the withholding of a response to the no-go digit 3). In the Fixed version of the SART, the digits 1-9 are presented within a fixed sequence that is repeated 25 times. In the Random version of the SART, the digits are presented in a pseudo-random order. All participants responded on the response cue.',\n",

The Y-axis represents the power of periodic changes in RT data. The X-axis represents the different temporal frequencies, in Hertz (Hz). The peak at 0.0772 Hz (reciprocal of 9 digits × 1.439 second inter-stimulus interval and marked by the dotted line) in the Fixed version of the SART is the Principle SART peak, and represents a consistent and distinct pattern of RT performance, such as a slowing in RT in response to digit 1, relative to digit 9 and 2, in preparation for the no-go response on digit 3 (Johnson et al., 2007). This peak is not present in the Random version, due to the random presentation of stimuli. Grand average spectra were calculated per group using the FFT function in MatLab 7.0 (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts).',\n",
