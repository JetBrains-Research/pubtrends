       "array(['Hypocrea/Trichoderma is a taxonomically difficult, hyperdiverse genus with an extraordinarily high number of species, similar to Fusarium sensu lato.',\n",
       "       'While in Fusarium the high species number is in part due to a heterogeneous assemblage of species based on the morphologically easily recognisable shape of macroconidia ( xref_bibr_R5 ), and Fusarium sensu stricto is more or less highly specialised to host plants ( xref_bibr_R57 ; xref_bibr_R46 ), the high diversity in Hypocrea/Trichoderma is a result of its hyperparasitic life style on other fungi. xref_bibr_R36 treated several aspects of the genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma, including the taxonomic history of the teleomorph genus Hypocrea and the anamorph genus Trichoderma, the development of the species concept, and important economic and social aspects.',\n",
       "       'He explained the strategy of species identification and recognition followed in the underlying project.',\n",
       "       'The project was designed to study the diversity of Hypocrea/Trichoderma starting from teleomorphs in Europe, because no such monograph was available for any continent including Europe, executed with a modern approach including multigene phylogeny.',\n",
       "       'A survey of 6 years resulted in about 620 specimens representing 75 species of Hypocrea.',\n",
       "       'For all species sequences of ITS, rpb2 and tef1 were obtained, except for the three species H. argillacea, H. splendens and H. strobilina, which could not be recollected despite intense searches. xref_bibr_R36 reported also on difficulties and reliability in ascospore isolation, and sketched the overall ecology of Hypocrea in Europe.',\n",
       "       'A phylogenetic strict consensus tree based on sequences of rpb2 and the tef1 exon of the genus comprising 135 species, showed all species detected in Europe including many from other continents or others that are only known as Trichoderma anamorphs.',\n",
       "       'He explained and defined the morphological traits used in the species descriptions and provided generalised descriptions of phenotypes of the Hypocrea teleomorph and the Trichoderma anamorph.',\n",
       "       'A diagram illustrated the variation of growth rates among the European species of Hypocrea/Trichoderma, excluding most of those known exclusively as anamorphs.',\n",
       "       'In the first part of this treatment xref_bibr_R36 keyed out and described the 19 green-spored species of Hypocrea detected in Europe in detail.',\n",
       "       'This second part serves to describe all 56 hyaline-spored species of Hypocrea currently recognised in Europe.',\n",
       "       'All materials and methods are as described by xref_bibr_R36 . xref_table_T1 lists cultures and GenBank accession numbers of those species numbered as Hypocrea sp. 1, 2, etc. in xref_bibr_R36 .',\n",
       "       'The following methodological issues are emphasised: 1) Colour perception is strongly dependent on lighting conditions and the magnification level.',\n",
       "       'A factor with strong impact on colour reproduction is the characteristics of digital cameras, particularly the mode of white balance.',\n",
       "       'Some images in the colour plates therefore deviate from the natural situation, most notably under-representing yellow hues in images taken through the stereo-microscope. 2) The reaction to 3% KOH has been examined after rehydration of dry stromata overnight by vapour in a wet chamber; it is usually weak or absent in immature stromata, therefore mature stromata have to be used for examinations. 3) The detailed descriptions and illustrations of cultures are based on conditions standardised for growth experiments as defined in xref_bibr_R36 .',\n",
       "       'Deviating conditions including the use of older cultures may cause different results; this may apply in particular to colony development, times and organisation of conidiation; the latter is also affected by the placement and shape of the inoculation plug.',\n",
       "       'Some additional explanations: ‘holomorph’ given in specimen data means that both stromata and closely associated anamorph colonies are present in the specimen; ‘under strong magnification’ used in connection with stromata (surface, ostiolar dots, etc.) means observations at highest magnification levels in the stereo-microscope; the abbreviation ‘t.’ means ‘textura’.',\n",
       "       'Types of teleomorphs and anamorphs were not examined of those recently described species unequivocally identified by gene sequences.',\n",
       "       'As done in the first part of the monograph ( xref_bibr_R36 ), both combinations in Hypocrea and Trichoderma are given for all species, for the following reasons: For species described earlier I want to provide as complete taxonomic and nomenclatorial information as possible, and for new species I also establish names in Trichoderma for those who may need them and to avoid numerous new combinations in future when they may be possibly used as holomorphic names if the ICBN is altered accordingly.',\n",
       "       'Article 59 and the recommendation 59A.3 of the ICBN demand the use of Hypocrea alone for the holomorphs, i.e. the anamorphs should not be named separately.',\n",
       "       'There is, however, increased pressure to use the anamorphic generic name Trichoderma.',\n",
       "       'Editors of certain journals are even trying to force authors to use Trichoderma instead of Hypocrea for naming new holomorphs, because Trichoderma is the older generic name.',\n",
       "       'Such a concept has not reached a consensus among mycologists and is accordingly not implemented in Art. 59.',\n",
       "       'To the contrary, this concept, using the older name in disregard whether it denotes a teleo- or an anamorph genus, aims at the abolishment of Art. 59 of the Code.',\n",
       "       'This is an alarming development, because forcing authors in such a direction is a top-down call to violate consensus-driven procedures and rules, i.e. a call towards non-compliance with the Code.',\n",
       "       'Furthermore this constraint is unfair to authors, because it diminishes the availability of journals for systematic mycologists.',\n",
       "       'In my opinion the disregard of a recommendation is much less severe than violating teleomorph priority that is clearly defined in Art. 59 of the Code.',\n",
       "       'The 56 species of Hypocrea with hyaline ascospores occurring in Europe are described in five separate chapters, predominantly grouped according to their phylogenetic placements and subsidiarily to their stroma shape and size.',\n",
       "       'The detailed descriptions are meant as small databases rather than concise descriptions for those who may study the morphology of these fungi in future.',\n",
       "       'Species are epitypified where appropriate.',\n",
