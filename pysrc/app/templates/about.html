        <a class="link" href="/">PubTrends</a> is an exploratory tool for researchers providing faster trends analysis
        and breakthrough papers
        discovery among the steadily growing flow of papers worldwide. The service aims to solve three tasks: give a
        brief overview of the field, explore popular trends in publications, and help to find new promising
        directions.<br>

    <h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>
    <p>
        PubTrends contains 30 mln papers and 175 mln citations of biomedical literature from the
        <a class="link"
           href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMedÂ®</a> database with 170 mln papers and 600 mln citations
        from the <a class="link" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> archive. Semantic Scholar
        aggregates significant journals and publishers, including Springer Nature, ACM, etc.<br>

    <h3>Main page</h3>
    <p>
        PubTrends main page is the start point for papers analysis, several analysis options are supported.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Search</strong><br>
            The service looks for papers matching the search query. Only papers containing search query in titles or
            abstracts are found.<br>
            The user can use double quotes to search for exact phrase or find documents, which
            contain all the words in the query. The number of papers can be quite significant, so it's natural to
            use some ranking and filtering to focus on either most cited, or most recent articles.<br>
            This set of papers is further extended by reference to papers which are similar, but may not contain some
            search words. <br>
            When working with PubMed database the user can use PubMed search syntax for the search query, in this case
            the service will use PubMed API to fetch list of papers for analysis. PubMed advanced search syntax
            allows searching in exact fields, limit publications by date and much more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Paper</strong><br>
            When user is interested in the particular paper, PubTrends can help user to
            find similar papers and most important prior and derivative works. The user can use title name of DOI for
            paper
            identification. The service will search for paper, analyze connected papers and proceed one step further by
            references to find out which of the connected papers have co-citations, common references, etc. When the set
            of papers is collected, papers similarity is analyzed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../static/about_main.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px;">
    <p>
        All the analysis is based on similarity between papers. Similarity is computed based on Bibliometrics features,
        i.e. <em>bibliographic coupling</em> (number of common references in a pair of papers), <em>co-citations</em>
        (when a pair of papers are cited together), <em>direct citations</em>, and text similarity between papers.
        This information is used to create papers citations graph.<br>
        Citations graph is later used to compute papers graph embeddings. Texts of titles and abstracts are used to
        compute papers text embeddings. Combined graph and text embeddings they are used for papers similarity analysis
        and topics identification by clustering. <br>
        Finally, the user gets full report covering all the aspects of analysis.</p>
    <p>
        Learn more exploring one of precomputed search queries from the <a class="link" href="/">PubTrends</a> main
        page.

    <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
    <p>Here we describe the analysis for the predefined search query <a
            class="link" target="_blank"
            href="https://PubTrends.net/result?source=Pubmed&sort=Most+Cited&limit=1000&noreviews=on&expand=20&jobid=predefined_013615a5e39aa14ae55eba6d2a89b068&query=%22human+aging%22"
    >"human aging"</a>. <br>
        We focus on 1000 most cited papers from the PubMed, with review papers, extending search set with connected
        papers by 20%.<br>
        The main report page contains all the analytics and consists of several parts: <a href="#papers">Papers</a>, <a

    <h4 id="papers">Papers</h4>
    <p>The Papers section demonstrates a birds-eye view of the field, including the total number of articles,
        and extracted topics. Word cloud shows the most frequent words in titles and abstracts. Also, it
        contains a summary plot of papers per year. Please note that the word cloud component is clickable, and
        you can navigate to the documents containing the selected word. Papers can be viewed as a plain list, as
        well.<br>
        Topics were computed by hierarchical clustering of papers embeddings based on text and graph embeddings.<br>

        The Trends section contains an interactive visualisation of top-cited papers, organised by number and
        citations count. Different types of articles are shown in different colours.<br>
        Most cited papers and papers with the quickest growth of citations are also shown here. All the papers are
        clickable, and we can explore details on a separate page.<br>
        Also the user can explore frequent keywords trends mentioned in papers.
