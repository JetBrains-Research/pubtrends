        <a class="link" href="/">PubTrends</a> is an exploratory tool for researchers providing faster trends analysis
        and breakthrough papers
        discovery among the steadily growing flow of papers worldwide. The service aims to solve three tasks: give a
        brief overview of the field, explore popular trends in publications, and help to find new promising
        directions.<br>

    <h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
    <p>
        PubTrends contains 30 mln papers and 175 mln citations of biomedical literature from the
        <a class="link"
           href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMedÂ®</a> database with 170 mln papers and 600 mln citations
        from the <a class="link" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> archive. Semantic Scholar
        aggregates significant journals and publishers, including Springer Nature, ACM, etc.<br>

    <h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../static/about_pubtrends_scheme.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px;">
    <p>
        All the analysis starts with
    <ul>
        <li>
            The search query - first of all most cited papers containing the search query are found.<br>
            User can use double quotes wrapping to search for exact phrase or find documents, which contain all the
            words in the query. The number of papers can be quite significant, so it's natural to
            use some ranking and filtering to focus on either most cited, or most recent articles.<br>
            This set of papers is further extended by reference to papers which are similar, but may not contain some of
            the search words.
        </li>
        <li>
            Single paper - the service looks for connected papers and proceeds one step further by
            references to find out which of the connected papers have co-citations, common references, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Next step is known as the Bibliometrics analysis, i.e. citations graph analysis, collecting co-citations (when a
    pair of papers are cited together), bibliographic coupling (number of common references in a pair of papers),
    and possible citations based on texts similarity. These values are combined into aggregated similarity score
    and are used to build papers graph. Papers graphs is available for additional exploration in interactive viewer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, user gets full report covering all the aspects of analysis.
    </p>
    <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
    <p>Here we describe the analysis for the search query <i>human aging</i>. <br>
        We focus on 1000 most cited papers from the PubMed, with review papers, extending search set with connected
        papers
        by 20%.<br>
        Learn more exploring one of precomputed search queries from the <a class="link" href="/">PubTrends</a> main
        page.

    <h4 id="report">Report</h4>
    <p>
        <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../static/about_humanaging_report.png"
             style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px"><br>
        The report page contains all the analytics and consists of several parts: Papers, Trends, Topics, etc.<br>
        Side bar on the left of the page can be used for navigation.<br>
        Please use About button - PubTrends will guide you through the report.
    </p>
    <h4 id="papers">Papers</h4>
    <p>The Papers section demonstrates a birds-eye view of the field, including the total number of articles,
        and extracted topics. Word cloud shows the most frequent words in titles and abstracts. Also, it
        contains a summary plot of papers per year. Please note that the word cloud component is clickable, and
        you can navigate to documents containing the selected word. Articles can be viewed as a plain list, as
        well.<br>
        Topics were computed by hierarchical clustering of papers embeddings based on text and graph embeddings.<br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="trends">Trends</h4>
    <p>
        The Trends section contains an interactive visualisation of top-cited papers, organised by number and
        citations count. Different types of articles are shown in different colours.<br>
        Most cited papers and papers with quickest growth of citations are also shown here. All the papers are
        clickable, and we can explore details on a separate page.
    </p>
    <h4 id="network">Network</h4>
    <p>
        Topics are closely related groups of documents. Similarity between papers is computed based on <em>bibliographic
        coupling</em>, <em>direct citations</em>, <em>co-citations</em>, and text similarity
        between papers. Community detection algorithm is used to extract dense clusters of papers or topics. Small
        topics
        are merged together to get reasonable number of topics.<br>
        Overall structure of topics within a research field can be visualised as a graph.
    </p>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../static/about_humanaging_graph.png"
         style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px"><br>
    <p>
        This graph allows you to find out the most important spots. Hover on any nodes to view paper details, filter
        papers with dedicated filter field, configure visualization options and more. On the screenshot you can see
        papers coloured by different topics and the paper is highlighted with its similar neighbours.
    </p>

    <h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>
    <p>In the section Topics for each topic, the application shows familiar to users word cloud and articles plot. Word
        cloud is built from terms specific to the given topic with respect to others. These words are computed using
        TF-IDF normalization, a standard approach in the field of natural language processing. The more important word
        is the more significant fraction of papers contains it.<br>
        The topic below is dedicated to DNA methylation changes related with <i>human aging</i>.<br>

        Generate a review for the chosen topic - a set of sentences from top cited papers with the highest probability
        to be included in a real review paper.</p>

    <h3 id="paper-analysis">Paper analysis</h3>
    <p>In case when user is interested in the particular paper, PubTrends can help user to find similar papers and
        most important prior and derivative works. User can use title name of DOI for paper identification. The service
        will search for paper, analyze connected papers and proceed one step further by references to find out which
        of the connected papers have co-citations, common references, etc. When the set of papers
        is collected, papers similarity is analyzed.
